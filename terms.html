        <div class="legal-section">
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of ToolGuard, a product of <strong>Elixie, LLC</strong> ("Elixie," "we," "us," or "our"). By creating an account or using ToolGuard, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using ToolGuard on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>1. The Service</h2>
            <p>ToolGuard is a security proxy for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that provides authenticated, policy-controlled access to external services and APIs. We provide the Service on a subscription basis through our website at toolguard.ai.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1 Eligibility.</strong> You must be at least 18 years old and capable of entering into a binding contract to use ToolGuard. If you are using ToolGuard on behalf of a business, that business must be validly formed and in good standing.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2 Account security.</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@toolguard.ai">support@toolguard.ai</a> if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3 Account accuracy.</strong> You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when registering and to keep that information updated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>3. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1 Plans.</strong> ToolGuard is offered on a free plan (with limitations) and paid subscription plans billed monthly or annually. Plan details and pricing are described at toolguard.ai/pricing.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2 Billing.</strong> By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis at the then-current price for your plan. Prices are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for any applicable taxes.</p>
            <p><strong>3.3 Plan changes.</strong> You may upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. You may switch between monthly and annual billing subject to any limitations of our payment processor. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades take effect at the next renewal period.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4 Renewal.</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless canceled before the renewal date.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>4. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
            <p><strong>4.1 Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@toolguard.ai">support@toolguard.ai</a>. Upon cancellation, you will retain access to the Service through the end of your current paid billing period. We do not charge cancellation fees.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2 Refunds — Annual plans.</strong> If you cancel an annual subscription within the first 30 days of the subscription start date, you may request a prorated refund for the unused portion of your term. After 30 days, annual subscriptions are non-refundable.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3 Refunds — Monthly plans.</strong> Monthly subscriptions are non-refundable. Cancellation stops future charges; no partial-month refunds are issued.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4 Free plan.</strong> The free plan may be discontinued or modified at any time with reasonable notice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree to use ToolGuard only for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms. You must not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abuse or circumvent access controls.</strong> Use ToolGuard to access, proxy, or interact with any service or API in a manner that violates that service's terms of use, exceeds your authorized access, or is otherwise unauthorized.</li>
                <li><strong>Interfere with the Service.</strong> Attempt to disrupt, degrade, or gain unauthorized access to ToolGuard's infrastructure, servers, or other users' accounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Engage in illegal activity.</strong> Use ToolGuard to transmit malware, conduct phishing attacks, engage in fraud, violate export control laws, or facilitate any illegal activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Resell or sublicense.</strong> Resell, sublicense, or otherwise provide access to the Service to third parties without our written consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrape or harvest.</strong> Use automated means to scrape, index, or harvest data from the Service beyond what is permitted by the product's intended functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Impersonate.</strong> Impersonate Elixie, LLC or any third party, or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
                <li><strong>Violate third-party rights.</strong> Infringe any intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of any third party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Violation of this section may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account without refund.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>ToolGuard acts as a proxy to third-party services (such as Gmail, GitHub, Slack, and others) on your behalf using credentials you provide. You are solely responsible for: (a) ensuring your use of those third-party services complies with their terms of service and acceptable use policies; (b) maintaining the security of any API keys, OAuth tokens, or credentials you connect to ToolGuard; and (c) any actions taken through ToolGuard on those services. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or actions of any third-party service.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p><strong>7.1 Our property.</strong> ToolGuard, including all software, designs, trademarks, and content, is owned by Elixie, LLC or its licensors. Nothing in these Terms grants you any ownership rights.</p>
            <p><strong>7.2 Your data.</strong> You retain ownership of any data you provide to or process through ToolGuard. You grant us a limited license to process your data solely to provide the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>7.3 Feedback.</strong> If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant Elixie, LLC a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use such feedback solely for the purpose of improving the Service.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>8. Privacy and Data</h2>
            <p>Your use of ToolGuard is subject to our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> (effective March 1, 2026), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. We collect and use data as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Data retention after termination.</strong> Upon termination of your account, we will delete your data within 30 days, including audit logs, policy configurations, and account information, except where retention is required by law. Billing and payment records are retained as required for tax and accounting compliance (typically 7 years). We do not offer data export for proxied content, as ToolGuard does not store your underlying API credentials or email content beyond what is needed to provide the Service in real time. Upon request, we will provide an export of your policy configurations and audit log data prior to deletion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
            <p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make ToolGuard available. However, we do not guarantee any specific uptime level. The Service may be unavailable due to scheduled maintenance, unplanned outages, or factors outside our control. We are not liable for any loss resulting from Service unavailability.</p>
            <p><strong>Security incidents.</strong> We implement industry-standard security measures, including TLS encryption for all data in transit and AES-256-GCM encryption for stored credentials. In the event of a security incident that affects your personal data, we will notify you promptly and no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the incident, where required by applicable law.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.</p>
            <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL PREVENT ALL UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, DATA BREACHES, OR SECURITY INCIDENTS. NO SECURITY SYSTEM IS INFALLIBLE, AND YOU ASSUME RISK ACCORDINGLY.</p>

IN NO EVENT SHALL ELIXIE, LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>

            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of California</strong>, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Before filing a claim, you agree to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@toolguard.ai">support@toolguard.ai</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days.</p>
        </div>

The affected party will promptly notify the other and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact.</p>
